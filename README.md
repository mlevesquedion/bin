# bin

Commande line tools I use often.

## Glossary

* ev : evaluate mathematical expressions (wrapper on eval)
* rmd : set up a screen-wide reminder some time from now
* goog : open a google search in default browser
* syn : open a synonyms page in default browser
* gt : open a google translate query in default browser

### A word of caution

Some of the scripts are badly written, because they're a year old. I'll rewrite them as I use and extend them.
